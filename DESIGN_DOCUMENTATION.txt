   - Range checking for numerical fields
   - Format validation for specific fields
   - Error reporting mechanism

2.3 Session Manager (session_manager.py)
--------------------------------------
Purpose: Manages chat sessions and maintains conversation state.

Key Components:
a) Session Handling
   - Unique session identification using UUID
   - Session creation and termination
   - State persistence between interactions

b) Message Management
   - Conversation history tracking
   - Message timestamping
   - Role-based message organization

c) Profile Association
   - Session-profile linking
   - Profile state management
   - Data persistence handling

2.4 Profile Summarizer (profile_summarizer.py)
-------------------------------------------
Purpose: Generates human-readable summaries of profile information.

Key Components:
a) Summary Generation
   - Context-aware text generation
   - Professional language formatting
   - Highlight selection logic

b) Integration
   - OpenAI API integration
   - Error handling and fallback mechanisms
   - Response processing and formatting

3. Data Flow
-----------
1. User Input → GUI
2. GUI → Session Manager (session context)
3. Session Manager → Profile Manager (data extraction)
4. Profile Manager → NLP Processing (intent/entity recognition)
5. Profile Manager → Profile Update
6. Profile Update → GUI Refresh
7. GUI → User Feedback
